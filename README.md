### Multiple Choice Quiz Application
This code implements a Spring Boot MVC application to display quiz questions with multiple 
choice answers.  The application builds the quiz objects from specifically formated XML documents, 
steps through presentation of each question, accepts the user answer, presents the correct answer and scores the results.
The presentation layer provides a limited demonstration of the use of Thymeleaf in MVC applications.
